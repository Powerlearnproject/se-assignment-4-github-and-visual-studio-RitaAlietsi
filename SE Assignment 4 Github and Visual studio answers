Watch Windows: Watch Window (Monitor the values of variables and expressions as your program executes), quickwatch (Evaluate expressions and variables on the fly without adding them to the watch window permanently).
immediate window: Execute code and evaluate expressions at runtime, which helps in testing small pieces of code or inspecting values without stopping the debugger.
Locals and Autos Windows: Locals Window (Display variables that are in the current scope.), autos window (Automatically display variables that are in the current line of code and the previous line).
Call Stack Window: Shows the call stack of the current thread, allowing you to trace the sequence of function calls that led to the current point of execution.
Threads Window: Inspect and control the threads in your application, including switching between threads and viewing their state.
Modules Window: Display information about the loaded modules (assemblies or DLLs) in your application, including version, path, and load status.
Disassembly Window: View the disassembled machine code for the currently executing instructions, useful for low-level debugging and optimization.
Memory Windows: Memory Window (Inspect memory contents at specific addresses), registers window (View the contents of CPU registers).
Exception Settings: Configure how the debugger handles exceptions, such as breaking when an exception is thrown or caught.
Diagnostic Tools: Performance Profiler (Analyze the performance of your application to identify bottlenecks.), memory usage (Track memory usage and detect memory leaks.), CPU usage (Monitor CPU usage and identify performance issues related to CPU utilization.).
DataTips: Hover over variables in your code to see their current value, type, and other information.

Use of these Tools to Identify and Fix Issues
Setting Breakpoints: Set breakpoints at strategic locations in your code to pause execution and inspect the state of the application. Use conditional breakpoints to target specific scenarios.
Inspecting Variables and Expressions: Use the Watch, Locals, and Autos windows to monitor variable values and expressions. This helps in understanding how data is changing over time and identifying incorrect values.
Tracing Execution Flow: Use the Call Stack window to trace the sequence of function calls leading to the current point of execution. This helps in identifying where the code deviates from expected behavior.
Evaluating Expressions: Use the Immediate Window and QuickWatch to evaluate expressions and test small pieces of code on the fly, helping to isolate issues quickly.
Analyzing Performance: Use the Performance Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your code. The Memory Usage tool helps in detecting memory leaks and inefficient memory usage.
